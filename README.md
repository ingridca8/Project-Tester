# HTML Project Testing Repository

Welcome to my HTML Project Testing repository! This repository contains various projects that I am working on and testing directly in a web environment using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each project is designed to be run in the browser for easy testing and development.

## Overview

This repository serves as a workspace for testing web-based projects and prototypes. Each project is displayed on an HTML page with integrated styles and scripts. This is particularly useful for testing front-end code, small web applications, or embedded scripts in a web environment.

### Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the web pages.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout design.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity and functionality.
- **Other Libraries**: Some projects may also use external libraries like jQuery, Bootstrap, or others (see each project for details).

## Projects

1. **Project 1: Project Title**
   - Description: Brief overview of the project.
   - Key Features: Highlight important functionality or features.
   - Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, other libraries (if any).
   - [Live Demo](link to HTML page in repository)

2. **Project 2: Project Title**
   - Description: Brief overview of the project.
   - Key Features: Highlight important functionality or features.

## How to Run

To run any of these projects locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
   cd your-repository-name

2. **Open the HTML file:**

Navigate to the project directory and open the index.html file in your browser. For example:

'''bash

    open project-folder/index.html

    Or you can directly open the HTML file in your preferred browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).

    Project-Specific Instructions:

    Some projects may require additional setup or instructions. Refer to the individual project's README.md or notes within the HTML file itself.
